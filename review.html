<p>Ardy is the best!!! He always takes his time and truly love what he does! I’ve always had a problem with nail
  techs rushing which led to my nails chipping or never lasting the full 2 weeks with gel
  or 3 weeks with dip! Thank goodness for Ardy because I do not ever feel as if I’m wasting my money
  and my nails look good the entire time in between Make an appointment with him ASAP!</p>

<p>I highly recommend Johnny I have been going to him for about 2 or 3 years now and he always does an AMAZING job.
These Christmas nails I got done yesterday are probably my favorite (besides my nails I had done for my wedding) but I am in love with glitter and he
 definitely gave me that!! Everyone is super nice and its definitely my favorite place to get my nails and toes done :)</p>

<p>I went there yesterday for the first time. The staff was very friendly & helpful. Ms Tina did my nails & she did a great job.
I would recommend them to anyone looking for a nail salon in Jackson. Thanks for making my first experience a great one!</p>

<p>Ardy is hands down the best at doing my hair. He’s always up for a challenge and really takes pride in what he does.
Cheyenne is my go to person for nails. She gets me in and out and when I can’t make up my mind about colors,
 I trust her in making a decision for me. I can’t say enough great things about this place ❤️</p>
